# TODO (or not todo)

- Split into separate files (e.g. `utils`, `config` etc).
- Move git-related bits/commands into dedicated helper (e.g. `GitUtils`).
- Add `help/dry-run/instuctions` mode.
- Offer to clean up, when an error occurs (don't clean up automatically, though).
- (?) Make the username/branch/repo configurable via cli arguments.
- (?) Add tests.
- Keep it simple!
- Publish to npm.
- Profit :)
